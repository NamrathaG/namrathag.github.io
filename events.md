  I co-organized the JITA 2024 Junior Conference, a multidisciplinary conference that allows Masters and PhD students in various fields of Theoretical and Applied Computer Science to present their research results. <br><br>

  My responsibilities included coordinating submissions and reviews on OpenReview, organizing the program 
  schedule, communicating with participants, and supporting the logistics of running the event.
